# AppLoad-RMStream

AppLoad-RMStream allows you to stream your reMarkable's screen to any device on the local network via HTTP.

It requires you to have both [AppLoad](https://github.com/asivery/rmpp-appload) and [framebuffer-spy](https://github.com/asivery/rmpp-xovi-extensions/tree/master/framebuffer-spy) installed.
